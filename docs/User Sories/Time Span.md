User Story

Time Span:
  The user first need to be logged in to our music app. Refer to the "Log In" user story for details about login and third-party authentication. After the first initial scan of the user's playlists and a list of recommended concerts, the user will be able to select a specific period of time before filtering through the concerts again. The user will be able to find out whether the recommended artists will be holding concerts during a specific time by filtering through month, date, year, or all three if he/she wants so that he/she will be able to arrange travel plans to a specific concert early on before ticket prices rise to an unaffordable amount.
